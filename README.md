# Learning PyTorch

A collection of Jupyter notebooks to learn and practice **PyTorch fundamentals** — from tensors and autograd to model building, training loops, data handling, and common architectures.

## Contents

- PyTorch fundamentals  
- Tensor operations  
- Autograd  
- Building models with `torch.nn`  
- Data handling (`Dataset`, `DataLoader`)  
- Training & validation loops  
- Intro to common architectures  
- Monitoring & debugging

## Getting Started

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install jupyter notebook
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```
### Run the notebooks
```bash
jupyter notebook
````
